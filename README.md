###### <p align=center>one day i will make cool rentries and strawpages the likes of which that you've never seen before! but fur now, here is some infurrmation while i work on them :-)

<div align="center"

 i am most often sitting by docks, around the upper left roblox area, or around the bakery/blacksmith. i usually log on and look for someone who has c+h freely or c+h encouraged or some other variation and sit with them!

 on that note, **i LOVE cuddles**! feel free to **cuddlepile** as well! i love it when people sit with me;  **anyone can sit with me anytime (even when i am on dni)**, NEVER feel scared to, and you can always ask beforehand if you would feel better that way. if you see me sitting alone and want me to come cuddle you,**you can whisper me and i will come over and cuddle you**! also **feel free to sit in front of me/cover me when cuddling**, i love it when people do that! you can also hide behind me if you want! if you want to friend me for the sole purpose of cuddling, that is fine too, just whisper to me and tell me beforehand and i will very likely accept! additionally, if i have cuddled with you before it is more likely that i will cuddle with you again :-)  <br> *the only time i would caution it is if i am with other people, but feel free to whisper me and them and ask :D* <br> feel free to kiss & boop me as well !

   <br> **you can 100% take inspiration** from my ponies, but do **not** completely copy them or post them on pinterest. i would love it if you showed me your result or asked me what you want to do, though! i always love to see what you guys do. :D

 please **whisper to interact with me**, it is very likely that i am offtab or my ponytown is in a small window and i will not see it, + i **always** have public chat disabled. if i miss your whisper/don't respond, i am very sorry! please do not take it personally, it is very possible that i did not see it.  always feel free to interact with me, i enjoy talking to people & conversing!! i can be kindof a bad conversationalist and sometimes I struggle to maintain them, but i will certainly try, & i try to be as kind as i can as well!!!!! feel free to talk at me about your interests though, and i would love to hear any fun facts or yaps you guys have about really any subject! i promise i am a good listener! however, **it is possible that i will disconnect**, as my internet access is limited. apologies if i leave in the middle of you saying something and don't return for many hours, it is **not your fault!**

  <br> i am _extremely_ scared of interacting with people, and it is very unlikely that i will not talk to you first. if we have been friends in the past and i have not talked to you in a while, it is **no fault of yours!** i am just very scared. this is because i have (unreasonable) fears relating to talking to others, i'm very sorry about this... <br> coupled with this, i also tend to ghost people for long periods of time, because i am hesitant to respond at first (or even open the communication app, like say discord for example), and then i think that it will be more horrible to respond later, so i don't respond. i am really sorry about this, it is just very hard for me and i hope you will be understanding. HOWEVER, this does not apply all of the time; sometimes i am in a better mood and more willing to talk to my friends and others, but it varies... additionally, when a conversation has started, i do away with a majority of these inhibitions, its mainly about getting conversations started. if you want to try and be my friend though, you can whisper to me like "i think you are cool and seem like being friends would be nice " and i will be very happy and willing to try, so don't be afraid! please, i do not have people I regularly talk to beside my brother...
  

  <br> i do not have a dni list, i will simply not interact with you + hide/block you if i do not like you. 
  <br> if you are interacting with me, i request that you do not say the r slur or t slur, or any sort of fatshaming jokes (even if you're referring to yourself), or any self harm jokes. they simply make me uncomfortable. if i did not tell you and you crossed one of these it is probably because i was scared, but please listen to them... along the same vein, if i do **ANYTHING** that makes you uncomfortable in ANY way, **PLEASE TELL ME!** I know how it feels and i do not wish to cause discomfort or harm to others!!! you can also tell me on my strawpage if you are too nervous to confront me in person, i don't mind how yew do it as long as you do because i want all my comrades happy !!!!!


  <br> my interests change very frequently, but currently i am rereading keeper of the lost cities! i forgot how fun those books are, and they're rather light (well, i don't know, perhaps fun is a better word? they're like trope-y and the main character may or may not be a BIT of a mary sue but there's suffering and angst along with FUN and little escapades and there's a lot of worldbuilding and i love it a lot right now !) (book 11...when.. ahaha...?...) and i need something lighter like that right now so it is good ! other media i have been absorbing recently is this absolutely HEARTBREAKING movie from 1986 called When The Wind Blows... watch it if you want to Suffer bro </3 . it's so lovely though, i really do like it! otherwise i'm pretty busy with schoolwork... and... notably not doing it... it's fine though Yep! #amicooked?
  
  <br> other interests of mine consist of guardians of ga'hoole (THE BOOKS SPECIFICALLY. I HATE THE MOVIE SO MUCH AND UPON MENTION OF IT I WILL LIKELY GET EXTREMELY ANGRY...) (PLEASE talk to me if you have read these books, they are SO SLEPT ON but they were GENUINELY SO AMAZING), all rick rioridan books except the kane chronicles... (I never got into them fur som reason ?..), fablehaven + dragonwatch, five kingdoms, captainsparklez & the people he plays with; namely X33N, kara, rifkin, skadj, jvckk, sophietexas, ozza, apple, ze, etc. fans of these guys are somehow extremely rare (_especially jvckk, considering he interacts with a LOT of hermits, it is mostly offstream so i guess it does make sense_), and if you also watch them feel free to interact with me!! i would love to meet another fan!!!, the serafina series (I really need to reread this one bro), (, wings of fire, the first 3 warriors series but i know a lot from the other arcs, keeper of the lost cities (this series is kinda fanservice lowky but I STILL LOVE IT SOO MUCH OK?OK), all three of charlotte mcconaghy books (EXCEPTIONALLT good and would recommend fur everyone to read, but DEFINITELY heed the trigger warnings), inanimate insanity (s1-s3), battle for dream island + xfohv (TPOT 20 GUYS????....), hermitcraft + the life series (mainly etho and tango povs) (I am not up to date with the end of S10 & anything to do with S11 though...), hfjone, the stanley parable, lego monkie king (HOLY GOATED) (s6 when....) (if you want a link to a playlist w/ all the episodes on youtube... feel free to whisper me!), dungeon meshi, the nightly manor, geometry dash (IM DOGWATER AT THIS GAME BUT ITS FUN AND THE COMMUNITY AND HISTORY OF IT IS VERY INTERESTING AND FUN!), PHIGHTING!, dandy's world, regretevator, mouthwashing, lifesteal smp, birds, some nuclear science/particle physics related stuff (shoutout bobbybroccoli on youtube my GOAT oh muy goly ... i need to watch that 17 pages documentary sO BAD IM DYING but im... dont have 3 dolar), specifically the super mario odyssey hide and seek crew (except moarf because he used ai for a LOT of his thumbnails so I lowky LOATHE him), digital and traditional art, MUSICC (shoutout joywave and kiltro and stomachbook and maneskin and boggio and yoyle cake and toby fox and c418 and czeslaw spiewa and grubson and molcaht doma and thefatrat and the crane wives and gipsy kings and the living tombstone and jack stauber and cg5 and uncle outrage and 10209092139 BILLION others), and HASAN HAMASABI PIKER #AMERICA DESERVED 9/11 AMIRITE GAMERS? (/j) (yes i do enjoy politics, a lot in fact! socialism on top! #read some gramsy. #entertain marxism. #watch some harper o'conner. i know a lot of people don't like to talk about it so i will never talk about it first unless you've made it clear its okay, but feel free to ask something related to it and i will probably provide a answer about it, will it be very good? i don't know... but also feel free to talk to me about politics because #I LIKE TO LEARN OK? im a big preponent of learning #learning is EPIK all my comrades love to become educated)  anyway i think that is it, barring all of my precious 100000000 youtube video essayists (any clark elieson fans in the chat? any objet petit a knowers in the chat?....) (I am simply too lazy to list them all here, but PLEASE feel free to ask for some recs!!! also feel free to rec some video essays to me as well!! of all the media that people recommend me, its most likely that i will actually like watch/listen/read/absorb it if it is either a book or a video essay. recommend me stuf :-) i actually have a strawpage just four this okay?okay... send me some media at https://cookieclicking.straw.page if yew want!
  

  <br> anyway, i just wanted to write some stuff. if you actually read all of this, that's pawesome, thank you very much! if you didn't or just skimmed, that is very understandable and fine as well! i hope you have a lovely day/night, friend ! :-) <br>
