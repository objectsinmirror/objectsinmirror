PFP art creds are PPINUT_BUTTER on twitter/x !! 

	remake...reamek soon guy.s....
	I'm a minor, i'm in school currently and have kinda a lot of homework so I'm often offtab, w2i is preferred, feel free to send a frq if we're sitting together I don't mind !! i love makin' friends ^_^ ;; i also have a job so will  likely be online less often because im busy working in the MINES!!!!
	I often use 4 to replace for, 2 to replace to/too, and I also use them in words (2gether, 4got), if you don't want me to do this around me PLEASE LET ME KNOW !!! i will have no idea otherwise...
	I type fast so I often have quite horrendous spelling but i CAN spell (if it bothers you tell me!!!)
 	I like talkin' to people, but i am still kindof a . really bad conversationalist . looks around.... expect lots of like... ouuus or WAOWZA!!!!s or general kinda like... unresponse-worthy responses? rest assured that i AM reading what you're saying and i DO care about it i just am like... completely unsure of how to formulate responses that are logical
  	I make kms/kys jokes and say (reclaimable) slurs (when im close to you), but if you don't like that PLEASE tell me and i will try and cut it out! i may forget but feel free to remind me!!!
	also I can be really mean/standoffish/blunt sometimes so if i have like iwc (interact with caution) in my name do pay attention to that... i'd reccommend just a general interact w/ caution though as i'm often mean without realising it
	i have a HUUUGEGEE touch comfort PLEASE!!! ANYONE!!! SIT WITH ME !!!! I LOVE IT!!! COVER ME AND HIDE ME OR HIDE BEHIND ME IDM!!!! it makes me very happuy:D
 	Feel free to take inspo from my ponies, as long as you're not just like.. completely copyin' them! you don't have to tell me but i'd love it if ya did because i lov seein' what you guys make!!
  
  	erum I think thats it?.. I don't really have a dni i suppose ... I guess if you're like 9 dni and also if you're like procontact para or somethin'.. i suppose limit interactions if you're EXTREMELY immature, or above like 20 years old, but i don't really mind nods nods! 
   	I have discord so feel free 2 hit me up for it if we are oomfes!!! I'm pretty active on there I'd say but sometimes it just like . DOES NOT WORK for like a month so if i suddenly am offline for an extended period of time i'm not ghosting you i am simply unable to access it,,,, claws at bars of enclosure...
    	If we were friends and i haven't interacted with you for a while, i have not replaced you or don't like you anymore or some such scenario, it's very likely that our friendship was sparse to begin with or fizzled out and i am DEATHLY afraid of interacting first, but don't feel nervous to talk to me even if it's been like a year,, i don't mind!! i love talkin' to people so i'd be happy to reconnect & stuff !!!
    	
	otherwise peace out!! have a lovely day/night :DD
