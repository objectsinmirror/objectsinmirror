  if you see me on pony.town, feel free to cuddle+hide with me !!! i love getting / giving cuds so dont be afraid to ! You can always whisper to ask me if you want as well !
  w2i is heavily preferred ! i will VERY likely miss your message otherwise... although sometimes i still miss whispers sent to me so if i do not respond, it is nothing against you! i probably closed the tab on accident or something like this .. !

  sometimes i'm online for 1000 days in a row and sometimes i'm offline for 1000 days in a row... look man idk i just work here ...
  
  feel free to recommend something to me ! of all the media that people recommend me, its most likely that i will actually like watch/listen/read/absorb it if it is either a book or a video essay. recommend me stuf :-) i actually have a strawpage just four this okay?okay... send me some media at https://cookieclicking.straw.page if yew want!
