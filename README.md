###### <p align=center>one day (in the _very_ distant future...) i will make cool rentries and strawpages the likes of which that you've never seen before! but fur now, here is some infurrmation while i work on them :-)

<div align="center"

 nowadays i am most often sitting by docks (specifically the trees above the benches), if i am not there I am probably around the upper left roblox area or around the bakery/blacksmith! if i am on party island, i'm either doing some sort of docks game (fashion roulette, fts, mafia, etc), otherwise i am probably trying to decide which item to hold or where to sit!
 
 <br> if my status is online, idle, or looking for chat, **feel free to interact with me**!! _please_ interact with me i love it when people interact with me!! i play this game to socialize!!! please int!!!!!! whispering me is preferred, but not entirely necessary, however if it seems like i missed your message if you used pubchat it would probably be best to w2i. I also **LOVE cuddles**! anyone can c+h w/ me at any time, even when i'm on some sort of dni! you can also whisper me if you want to check, but this is not necessary! you can c+h w/ me however, i don't mind being covered/your pony sitting in front of mine, and you can hide behind me if you would like that as well! if my status is busy, i may take a bit of time to notice interactions, as i am likely offtab/afk/etc!

###### <p align=center>interacting w/ me stuff 
   **you can 100% take inspiration** from my ponies, but do **not** completely copy them or post them on pinterest. i would love it if you showed me your result or asked me what you want to do, though! i always love to see what you guys do. :D!!!
  <br> my dni list consists of hateful/bigoted people (racist, ableist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic, etc) and freaks/darkshippers/proshippers and people who say/do nsfw/suggestive things on the safe, otherwise i will simply not interact with you + hide/block you if i do not like you
  <br> if you are interacting with me, i request that you do not say the r slur or t slur, any sort of fatshaming jokes (even if you're referring to yourself), sexual assault jokes, or self harm jokes. in the same vein, if i do **ANYTHING** that makes you uncomfortable in _any_ way, **PLEASE TELL ME!** I know how it feels and i do not wish to cause discomfort or harm to others! you can also tell me on my strawpage if you are too nervous to confront me in person, i don't mind how you do it at all! also, i call everyone comrade. like EVERYONE. it's like my version of bro/vro, if you don't like being called comrade please tell me LMAO...
  <br> i sometimes/often struggle to understand things, if my reply to something you said is kinda nonsensical it is likely i misinterpreted what you were saying, i also might not realise this so i would appreciate it if you told me that my answer is weird or something, i will not be offended! similarly, i might ask for you to simplify what you are saying because i do not understand it, i know that this behaviour may become annoying but i assure you that i am trying my best, and if you are becoming irritated then it probably means we should take some time apart/not be friends, or we can have a conversation about what to do about it if you wish to continue talking to me, i do not mind!

  <br> considering the fact that my interests change very frequently, i kinda do better with conversations that are about real life (?)/not fandom related things, stuff like how's school or who's annoying at work or what you're cooking for dinner or something interesting your family said or a cool thing you got or how your pets are doing or a new project you're working on, stuff like that! in general i LOVE to hear about people's lives, so you can _ALWAYS_ yap to me about things like that, even if we've never talked before/haven't talked in a long time!!!  also feel free to yap about things like your oc lore / fandom headcanons / your hyperfixs/spinterests , generally longwinded/rambly things like that!!! i very much like listening to them. this is also not to say, like, never talk about fandom things to me, i will try and be a good conversationalist and some fandom talks i have are really good, i just like these more concrete things more and i find that they're more consistent to talk about if you want to be friends w/ someone! ^<^
  <br>




###### <p align=center>interests and related things .. may or may not be slightly outdated...
currently i am rereading keeper of the lost cities! i forgot how fun those books are, and they're rather light (well, i don't know, perhaps fun is a better word? they're like trope-y and the main character may or may not be a BIT of a mary sue but there's suffering and angst along with FUN and little escapades and there's a lot of worldbuilding and i love it a lot right now !) (book 11...when.. ahaha...?...) and i need something lighter like that right now so it is good ! other media i have been absorbing recently is this absolutely HEARTBREAKING movie from 1986 called When The Wind Blows... watch it if you want to Suffer bro </3 . it's so lovely though, i really do like it! otherwise i'm pretty busy with schoolwork... and... notably not doing it... it's fine though Yep! #amicooked?
  
  <br> other interests of mine consist of guardians of ga'hoole (THE BOOKS SPECIFICALLY. I HATE THE MOVIE SO MUCH AND UPON MENTION OF IT I WILL LIKELY GET EXTREMELY ANGRY...)

(I never got into them fur som reason ?..), fablehaven + dragonwatch, five kingdoms, captainsparklez & the people he plays with; namely X33N, kara, rifkin, skadj, jvckk, sophietexas, ozza, apple, ze, etc. fans of these guys are somehow extremely rare (_especially jvckk, considering he interacts with a LOT of hermits, it is mostly offstream so i guess it does make sense_), and if you also watch them feel free to interact with me!! i would love to meet another fan!!!, the serafina series (I really need to reread this one bro), (, wings of fire, the first 3 warriors series but i know a lot from the other arcs, keeper of the lost cities (this series is kinda fanservice lowky but I STILL LOVE IT SOO MUCH OK?OK), all three of charlotte mcconaghy books (EXCEPTIONALLT good and would recommend fur everyone to read, but DEFINITELY heed the trigger warnings), inanimate insanity (s1-s3), battle for dream island + xfohv (TPOT 20 GUYS????....), hermitcraft + the life series (mainly etho and tango povs) (I am not up to date with the end of S10 & anything to do with S11 though...), hfjone, the stanley parable, lego monkie king (HOLY GOATED) (s6 when....) (if you want a link to a playlist w/ all the episodes on youtube... feel free to whisper me!), dungeon meshi, the nightly manor, geometry dash (IM DOGWATER AT THIS GAME BUT ITS FUN AND THE COMMUNITY AND HISTORY OF IT IS VERY INTERESTING AND FUN!), PHIGHTING!, dandy's world, regretevator, mouthwashing, lifesteal smp, birds, some nuclear science/particle physics related stuff (shoutout bobbybroccoli on youtube my GOAT oh muy goly ... i need to watch that 17 pages documentary sO BAD IM DYING but im... dont have 3 dolar), specifically the super mario odyssey hide and seek crew (except moarf because he used ai for a LOT of his thumbnails so I lowky LOATHE him), digital and traditional art, MUSICC (shoutout joywave and kiltro and stomachbook and maneskin and boggio and yoyle cake and toby fox and c418 and czeslaw spiewa and grubson and molcaht doma and thefatrat and the crane wives and gipsy kings and the living tombstone and jack stauber and cg5 and uncle outrage and 10209092139 BILLION others), and HASAN HAMASABI PIKER #KAYAGATE (/j) (yes i do enjoy politics, a lot in fact! i know a lot of people don't like to talk about it so i will never talk about it first unless you've made it clear its okay, but feel free to ask something related to it and i will probably provide a answer about it, will it be very good? i don't know... but also feel free to talk to me about politics because #I LIKE TO LEARN OK? im a big preponent of learning #learning is EPIK all my comrades love to become educated)  anyway i think that is it, barring all of my precious 100000000 youtube video essayists (any clark elieson fans in the chat? any objet petit a knowers in the chat?....) (I am simply too lazy to list them all here, but PLEASE feel free to ask for some recs!!! also feel free to rec some video essays to me as well!! of all the media that people recommend me, its most likely that i will actually like watch/listen/read/absorb it if it is either a book or a video essay. recommend me stuf :-) i actually have a strawpage just four this okay?okay... send me some media at https://cookieclicking.straw.page if yew want!

  ###### <p align=center>miscellaeneous

  <br> also, if we have been friends for a while and haven't interacted in also a long time (like 99% of people on my friends list..), it's because i'm scared of talking to you, i don't hate you or anything... feel free to hit me up though Guys alrighty...? (i'm going ot be honest i may or may not've forgotten who a lot of you were... scratches chin,
