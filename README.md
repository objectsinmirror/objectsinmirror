hellow friends ! i am putting this here to say im taking a sort of break from ponytown, or really ive been on break for a couple months now but im finally putting it here lawl... in short nowadays i'd like to be on this game to have specific social interactions rather than c+hing with someone for hours, which is what i have been doing for several months now. however, i am a busy guy nowadays and i do not have much time to spare for friends, and this coupled with the fact that i have not talked to any of my ponytown friends in a long time means i have little to no motivation to be on. i have also changed greatly from how i was when i was most active (back in september 2024--july/august (?) 2025), and ifwhen i come back id probably like to meet new people more organically. i may rarely log on just to see if theres an fts or fashion roulette happening, but i will probably not stay for long. perhaps one day i will be more active on ponytown, but that day is not today, and its not tomorrow if this message is still here. if yiu wish to still contact me or talk to me for whatever reason, you can hit me up on discord, my username is renduskkey, i have all dms and frqs on, though please preface your message with who you are so i dont get confused or deny it. i hope yiu all have a very pawesome day and as always , participate in some mutual aid yo !! or else me electrocute you.

  if you see me on pony.town, feel free to cuddle+hide with me !!! i love getting / giving cuds so dont be afraid to ! You can always whisper to ask me if you want as well !
  w2i is heavily preferred ! i will VERY likely miss your message otherwise... although sometimes i still miss whispers sent to me so if i do not respond, it is nothing against you! i probably closed the tab on accident or something like this .. !
  
  feel free to recommend something to me ! of all the media that people recommend me, its most likely that i will actually like watch/listen/read/absorb it if it is either a book or a video essay. recommend me stuf :-) i actually have a strawpage just four this okay?okay... send me some media at https://cookieclicking.straw.page if yew want!

 i hope you (yes YOU, YOU reading this RIGHT NOW!) have some yummy food and a good restful nights sleep! remember to drink water and untense your jaw okay ? okay! ^<^!  <br>
