###### <p align=center>one day i will make cool rentries and strawpages the likes of which that you've never seen before! but fur now, here is some infurrmation while i work on them :-)

<div align="center"

 i am most often sitting by docks, around the upper left roblox area, or around the bakery/blacksmith. i usually log on and look for someone who has c+h freely or c+h encouraged or some other variation and sit with them!

 on that note, **i LOVE cuddles**! feel free to **cuddlepile** as well! i love it when people sit with me;  **anyone can sit with me anytime (even when i am on dni)**, NEVER feel scared to, and you can always ask beforehand if you would feel better that way. if you see me sitting alone and want me to come cuddle you,**you can whisper me and i will come over and cuddle you**! also **feel free to sit in front of me/cover me when cuddling**, i love it when people do that! you can also hide behind me if you want! if you want to friend me for the sole purpose of cuddling, that is fine too, just whisper to me and tell me beforehand and i will very likely accept! additionally, if i have cuddled with you before it is more likely that i will cuddle with you again :-)  <br> *the only time i would caution it is if i am with other people, but feel free to whisper me and them and ask :D* <br> feel free to kiss & boop me as well !

   <br> **you can 100% take inspiration** from my ponies, but do **not** completely copy them or post them on pinterest. i would love it if you showed me your result or asked me what you want to do, though! i always love to see what you guys do. :D

 please **whisper to interact with me**, it is very likely that i am offtab or my ponytown is in a small window and i will not see it, + i **always** have public chat disabled. if i miss your whisper/don't respond, i am very sorry! please do not take it personally, it is possible that i did not see it.  always feel free to interact with me, i enjoy talking to people. however, i am an exceptionally bad conversationalist, and i struggle to maintain them. i will certainly try, however, & i try to be as kind as i can as well. feel free to talk at me about your interests though, and i would love to hear any fun facts or yaps you guys have about really any subject! i promise i am a good listener! however, **it is possible that i will disconnect**, as my internet access is limited. apologies if i leave in the middle of you saying something and don't return for many hours, it is **not your fault!**

  <br> i am _extremely_ scared of interacting with people, and it is very unlikely that i will not talk to you first. if we have been friends in the past and i have not talked to you in a while, it is **no fault of yours!** i am just very scared. this is because i have an intense fear of people disliking me, and i try to limit interactions with others due to this, because if you never talk to someone surely they can't hate you, right? ahaha.... hah..... im very sorry about this.. <br> coupled with this, i also tend to ghost people for long periods of time, because i am hesitant to respond at first (or even open the communication app, like say discord for example), and then i think that it will be more horrible to respond later, so i don't respond. i am really sorry about this, it is just very hard for me and i hope you will be understanding.

  <br> i do not have a dni list, i will simply not interact with you + hide/block you if i do not like you. 
  <br> if you are interacting with me, i request that you do not say the r slur or t slur, or any fatshaming jokes, or any self harm jokes. they simply make me uncomfortable. along the same vein, if i do **ANYTHING** that makes you uncomfortable in ANY way, **PLEASE TELL ME!** I know how it feels and i do not wish to cause discomfort or harm to others.


  <br> my interests change very frequently, but i have **always** loved captainsparklez & the people he plays with; namely X33N, kara, rifkin, skadj, jvckk, sophietexas, ozza, apple, ze, etc. fans of these guys are somehow extremely rare (_especially jvckk, considering he interacts with a LOT of hermits, it is mostly offstream so i guess it does make sense_), and if you also watch them feel free to interact with me!! i would love to meet another fan!!! i have watched all of captainsparklez' stoneblock 3, lethal company, among us, codenames, sky factory 4, mianite s1 + 2, and some of his ragnamod & mceternal. i'm currently rewatching all of the among us vods and his reclamation series with X33N. here is your captainsparklez fun fact: he has never lived in a place that has gotten trick-or-treaters! (unfortunetly i didn't start writing down the vods i got the fun facts from until recently, but i do know it was a codenames vod. curse past me, shakes fist in an outraged manner!).
  <br> other interests of mine consist of guardians of ga'hoole (THE BOOKS SPECIFICALLY) (PLEASE talk to me if you have read these books, they are SO SLEPT ON but they were GENUINELY SO AMAZING), all rick rioridan books except the kane chronicles..., fablehaven + dragonwatch, five kingdoms, the serafina series, the last dragon chronicles, wings of fire, the first 4 warriors series but i know a lot from the other arcs, keeper of the lost cities, all three of charlotte mcconaghy books (exceptionally good, but definitely mind the trigger warnings), inanimate insanity (s1-s3), battle for dream island + xfohv, hermitcraft + the life series (mainly etho and tango povs), hfjone, the stanley parable, lego monkie king, dungeon meshi, the nightly manor, geometry dash, PHIGHTING!, dandy's world, regretevator, mouthwashing, lifesteal smp, birds, some nuclear science/particle physics related stuff (shoutout bobbybroccoli on youtube my GOAT), specifically the super mario odyssey hide and seek crew (except moarf because he used ai for a LOT of his thumbnails which is GROSS bro), digital and traditional art, MUSICC (shoutout joywave and kiltro and stomachbook and maneskin and boggio and yoyle cake and toby fox and c418 and czeslaw spiewa and grubson and molcaht doma and thefatrat and the crane wives and gipsy kings and the living tombstone and jack stauber and cg5 and uncle outrage and 10209092139 BILLION others), and i think that is it. please note that i am not an activae participant in any fandom, and i mostly like them for their story and characters... i swear i am not one of the very annoying object show fans or roblox game fans...
  

  <br> anyway, i just wanted to write some stuff. if you actually read all of this, that's pawesome, thank you very much! if you didn't or just skimmed, that is very understandable and fine as well! i hope you have a lovely day/night, friend ! :-) <br>
